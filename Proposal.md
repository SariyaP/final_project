# Project Proposal Evaluation
## **Overall process will look like this:**

Login -> Based on the role code -> Editing process -> Logout

Therefore, In this code we will base the code for each role.

### **For Admin:**

- While letting the admin choose which information they want to edit.

### **For Students:**

- First of all they can start by creating a project which will randomly generate the project ID.
- Project can be edited and will be saved after the changes, students can view all their projects.
- They can find members by their ID number then invite them to create a group.
- See the invitations from other students.
- They can send the report which will notify the advisor faculty to see.

### **For Faculty**

- People who login as faculty can see the request from students about advisor approval, they can deny or accept.
